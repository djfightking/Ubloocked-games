                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>Use the arrow keys or WASD to move. Jump from side to side to climb up walls. Play new acts by standing on their act block and pressing the down arrow key. Purple blocks are weak so they will fall down if you step on them. Orange blocks are super bouncy and are great if you want to jump high into the air! The game contains many checkpoints, so you can always start from the latest one when you die.</p>
